TT_PLATFORM = """
Platform identifier codes.

- `APPLE_UNICODE`: Used by Apple to indicate a Unicode character map
  and/or name entry. See `TT_APPLE_ID` for corresponding ‘encoding_id’
  values. Note that name entries in this format are coded as
  big-endian UCS-2 character codes only.

- `MACINTOSH`: Used by Apple to indicate a MacOS-specific charmap
  and/or name entry. See `TT_MAC_ID` for corresponding ‘encoding_id’
  values. Note that most TrueType fonts contain an Apple roman charmap
  to be usable on MacOS systems (even if they contain a Microsoft
  charmap as well).

- `ISO`: This value was used to specify ISO/IEC 10646 charmaps. It is
  however now deprecated. See `TT_ISO_ID` for a list of
  corresponding ‘encoding_id’ values.

- `MICROSOFT`: Used by Microsoft to indicate Windows-specific
  charmaps. See `TT_MS_ID` for a list of corresponding ‘encoding_id’
  values. Note that most fonts contain a Unicode charmap using
  (`TT_PLATFORM.MICROSOFT`, `TT_MS_ID.UNICODE_CS`).

- `CUSTOM`: Used to indicate application-specific charmaps.

- `ADOBE`: This value isn't part of any font format specification, but
  is used by FreeType to report Adobe-specific charmaps in an
  `CharMap` object. See `TT_ADOBE_ID`.
"""

TT_APPLE_ID = """
Apple-specific encoding values.

- `DEFAULT`: Unicode version 1.0.

- `UNICODE_2_0`: Unicode 2.0 and beyond (UTF-16 BMP only).

- `UNICODE_32`: Unicode 3.1 and beyond, using UTF-32.

- `VARIANT_SELECTOR`: From Adobe, not Apple. Not a normal
  cmap. Specifies variations on a real cmap.
