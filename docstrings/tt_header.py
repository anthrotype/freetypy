- `LEFT_BLACK_BIT_IS_LSB`: If set, the *x*-position of the leftmost
  black bit is assumed to be the left side bearing.

- `NONLINEAR_SCALE`: If set, instructions may use point size
  explicitly in place of pixels per em. Scaled point size and actual
  point size will differ (i.e. 24 point glyph differs from 12 point
  glyph scaled by factor of 2).

- `INTEGER_SCALING`: Use integer scaling instead of fractional.

- `VERTICAL`: Set in fonts that are intended to ne laid out
  vertically, and in which the glyphs have been drawn such that an
  *x*-coordinate of 0 corresponds to the desired vertical baseline.

- `REQUIRES_LAYOUT`: Set if the font requires layout for correct
  linguistic rendering (e.g. Arabic fonts).

- `METAMORPHOSIS_EFFECTS`: Set for a GX font which has one or more
  metamorphosis effects designated as happening by default.

- `RIGHT_TO_LEFT_GLYPHS`: Set if the font contains any strong
  right-to-left glyphs.

- `INDIC_REARRANGEMENT_EFFECTS`: Set if the font contains Indic-style
  rearrangement effects.
