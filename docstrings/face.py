face : Face instance
"""

Face_ascender = """
The typographic ascender of the face, expressed in font units. For
font formats not having this information, it is set to
`BBox.yMax`. Only relevant for scalable formats.
"""

Face_attach = """
‘Attach’ data to a face object.

Normally, this is used to read additional information for the face

from the font. Thus, `BBox.y_max` can be seen as the ‘maximum
ascender’, and `BBox.y_min` as the ‘minimum descender’. Only relevant
for scalable formats.

Note that the bounding box might be off by (at least) one pixel for
hinted fonts. See `Size_Metrics` for further discussion.

The face's family name. This is an ASCII string, usually in English,
which describes the typeface's family (like ‘Times New Roman’,
‘Bodoni’, ‘Garamond’, etc). This is a least common denominator used to
list fonts. Some formats (TrueType & OpenType) provide localized and
Unicode versions of this string. Applications should use the format
specific interface to access them. Can be `None` (e.g., in fonts

"""

Face_load_glyph = """
Load a single glyph.

Parameters
----------
glyph_index	: int
    The index of the glyph in the font file. For CID-keyed fonts
    (either in PS or in CFF format) this argument specifies the CID
    value.

load_flags : int, optional
    A flag indicating what to load for this glyph. The `LOAD`
    constants can be used to control the glyph loading process (e.g.,
    whether the outline should be scaled, whether to load bitmaps or
    not, whether to hint the outline, etc).

Returns
-------
glyph : Glyph
    The loaded `Glyph`.

Notes
-----
By default, hinting is enabled and the font's native hinter (see
`FACE_FLAG.HINTER`) is preferred over the auto-hinter. You can disable
hinting by setting `LOAD.NO_HINTING` or change the precedence by
setting `LOAD.FORCE_AUTOHINT`. You can also set `LOAD.NO_AUTOHINT` in
case you don't want the auto-hinter to be used at all.

See the description of `FACE_FLAG.TRICKY` for a special exception
(affecting only a handful of Asian fonts).

Besides deciding which hinter to use, you can also decide which
hinting algorithm to use. See `LOAD`'s ``TARGET_XXX`` constants for
details.

Note that the auto-hinter needs a valid Unicode cmap (either a native
one or synthesized by FreeType) for producing correct results. If a
font provides an incorrect mapping (for example, assigning the
char code U+005A, LATIN CAPITAL LETTER Z, to a glyph depicting a
mathematical integral sign), the auto-hinter might produce useless
results.

The loaded glyph may be transformed. See `set_transform` for the
details.

For subsetted CID-keyed fonts, a `ValueError` exception is thrown for
invalid CID values (this is, for CID values which don't have a
corresponding glyph in the font). See the discussion of the
`FACE_FLAG.CID_KEYED` flag for more details.

You should use only one of the `LOAD` ``TARGET_XXX`` values in your
`load_flags`. They can't be OR'ed.

If `LOAD.RENDER` is also set, the glyph is rendered in the
corresponding mode (i.e., the mode which matches the used algorithm
best). An exception is `LOAD.TARGET_MONO` since it implies
`LOAD.MONOCHROME`.
"""

Face_max_advance_height = """
The maximum advance height, in font units, for all glyphs in this

"""

Face_num_faces = """
The number of faces in the font file. Some font formats can have
multiple faces in a font file.
"""

Face_num_fixed_sizes = """
The number of bitmap strikes in the face. Even if the face is
scalable, there might still be bitmap strikes, which are called
‘sbits’ in that case.
"""

Face_num_glyphs = """
The number of glyphs in the face. If the face is scalable and has
sbits (see `num_fixed_sizes`), it is set to the number of outline
glyphs.

font.
"""

Face_request_size = """
Resize the scale of the active `Size` object in a face.

Parameters
----------
type : size request constant
    The size request type.  See `SIZE_REQUEST_TYPE` for the available
    constants.

width : float, optional
    The desired width.

height : float, optional
    The desired height.

horiResolution : int, optional
    The horizontal resolution.  If set to zero, `width` is treated as a
    fractional pixel value.

vertResolution : int, optional
    The vertical resolution.  If set to zero, `height` is treated as a
    fractional pixel value.

Notes
-----
If `width` is zero, then the horizontal scaling value is set equal to
the vertical scaling value, and vice versa.

Although drivers may select the bitmap strike matching the request,
you should not rely on this if you intend to select a particular
bitmap strike. Use `select_size` instead in that case.

The relation between the requested size and the resulting glyph size
is dependent entirely on how the size is defined in the source
face. The font designer chooses the final size of each glyph relative
to this size. For more information refer to
`<http://www.freetype.org/freetype2/docs/glyphs/glyphs-2.html>`_.

See `Size_Metrics` for how size requesting relates to scaling values.
"""

Face_select_charmap = """
Select a given charmap by its encoding tag.

Parameters
----------
encoding : int
    An encoding constant.  See `ENCODING`.

Notes
-----
This function raises an exception if no charmap in the face corresponds
to the encoding queried here.

Because many fonts contain more than a single cmap for Unicode
encoding, this function has some special code to select the one which
covers Unicode best (‘best’ in the sense that a UCS-4 cmap is
preferred to a UCS-2 cmap). It is thus preferable to use `set_charmap`
in this case.
"""

Face_select_size = """
Select a bitmap strike.

Parameters
----------
strike_index : int
    The index of the bitmap strike in the `~Face.available_sizes`
    field.
"""

Face_set_char_size = """
Set the nominal font size (in points).

Parameters
----------
char_width : float, optional
    The nominal width, in fractional points.

char_height : float, optional
    The nominal height, in fractional points.

horz_resolution : int, optional
    The horizontal resolution, in dpi.

vert_resolution : int, optional
    The vertical resolution, in dpi.

Notes
-----
If either the character width or height is zero (or not provided), it
is set equal to the other value.  |freetypy|: If both width and height
are not provided, it defaults to 12.0.

If either the horizontal or vertical resolution is zero, it is set
equal to the other value. If both resolution values are zero, they are
set to 72dpi.
"""

Face_set_charmap = """
Select a charmap for char code to glyph index mapping.

Parameters
----------
charmap_index : int
    The index in `charmaps` to use.

-----
This fails if a type 14 charmap is selected.
"""

Face_set_transform = """
Set the transformation applied to glyph images.

Parameters
----------
matrix : 2x2 sequence of floats, optional
    A matrix of the form::

      .  [[xx, xy]
      .   [yx, yy]]

delta : 2-sequence of floats, optional

Notes
-----
The transformation is only applied to scalable image formats after the
glyph has been loaded. It means that hinting is unaltered by the
transformation and is performed on the character size given in the
last call to `set_char_size` or `set_pixel_sizes`.

Note that this also transforms the `Face.glyph.advance` field, but not
the values in `Face.glyph.metrics`.

"""

FACE_FLAG = """
Bit flags for important metadata about a `Face`.

- `SCALABLE`: Indicates that the face contains outline glyphs. This
  doesn't prevent bitmap strikes, i.e., a face can have both this and
  and `FACE_FLAG.FIXED_SIZES` set.

- `FIXED_SIZES`: Indicates that the face contains bitmap strikes. See
  also `Face.available_sizes`.

- `FIXED_WIDTH`: Indicates that the face contains fixed-width
  characters (like Courier, Lucido, MonoType, etc.).

- `SFNT`: Indicates that the face uses the ‘sfnt’ storage scheme. For
  now, this means TrueType and OpenType.

- `HORIZONTAL`: Indicates that the face contains horizontal glyph
  metrics. This should be set for all common formats.

- `VERTICAL`: Indicates that the face contains vertical glyph
  metrics. This is only available in some formats, not all of them.

- `KERNING`: Indicates that the face contains kerning information. If
  set, the kerning distance can be retrieved through
  `Face.get_kerning`. Otherwise the function always returns the vector
  (0, 0). Note that FreeType doesn't handle kerning data from the
  ‘GPOS’ table (as present in some OpenType fonts).

- `MULTIPLE_MASTERS`: Indicates that the font contains multiple
  masters and is capable of interpolating between them. See the
  multiple-masters specific API for details.

- `GLYPH_NAMES`: Indicates that the font contains glyph names that can
  be retrieved through `Face.get_glyph_name`. Note that some TrueType
  fonts contain broken glyph name tables. Use the function
  `Face.has_ps_glyph_names` when needed.

- `EXTERNAL_STREAM`: Used internally by FreeType to indicate that a
  face's stream was provided by the client application and should not
  be destroyed when the face is destructed. Don't read or test this
  flag.

- `HINTER`: Set if the font driver has a hinting machine of its
  own. For example, with TrueType fonts, it makes sense to use data
  from the SFNT ‘gasp’ table only if the native TrueType hinting
  engine (with the bytecode interpreter) is available and active.

- `CID_KEYED`: Set if the font is CID-keyed. In that case, the font is
  not accessed by glyph indices but by CID values. For subsetted
  CID-keyed fonts this has the consequence that not all index values
  are a valid argument to `Face.load_glyph`. Only the CID values for
  which corresponding glyphs in the subsetted font exist make
  `Face.load_glyph` return successfully; in all other cases you get a
  `ValueError` exception.

  Note that CID-keyed fonts which are in an SFNT wrapper don't have
  this flag set since the glyphs are accessed in the normal way (using
  contiguous indices); the ‘CID-ness’ isn't visible to the
  application.

- `TRICKY`: Set if the font is ‘tricky’, this is, it always needs the
  font format's native hinting engine to get a reasonable result. A
  typical example is the Chinese font ‘mingli.ttf’ which uses TrueType
  bytecode instructions to move and scale all of its subglyphs.

  It is not possible to autohint such fonts using
  `LOAD.FORCE_AUTOHINT`; it will also ignore `LOAD.NO_HINTING`. You
  have to set both `LOAD.NO_HINTING` and `LOAD.NO_AUTOHINT` to really
  disable hinting; however, you probably never want this except for
  demonstration purposes.

  Currently, there are about a dozen TrueType fonts in the list of
  tricky fonts; they are hard-coded.
"""

STYLE_FLAG = """
Bit flags indicating the style of a `Face`.

- `ITALIC`: Indicates that a given face style is italic
  or oblique.

- `BOLD`: Indicates that a given face is bold.
"""

LOAD = """
Indicates what to load for a glyph.

The `LOAD` constants can be used to control the glyph loading process
(e.g., whether the outline should be scaled, whether to load bitmaps
or not, whether to hint the outline, etc).

- `DEFAULT`: Corresponding to 0, this value is used as the default
  glyph load operation. In this case, the following happens:

    1. FreeType looks for a bitmap for the glyph corresponding to the
       face's current size. If one is found, the function returns. The
       bitmap data can be accessed from the glyph slot (see note
       below).

    2. If no embedded bitmap is searched or found, FreeType looks for
       a scalable outline. If one is found, it is loaded from the font
       file, scaled to device pixels, then ‘hinted’ to the pixel grid
       in order to optimize it. The outline data can be accessed from
       the glyph slot (see note below).

  Note that by default, the glyph loader doesn't render outlines into
  bitmaps. The following flags are used to modify this default
  behaviour to more specific and useful cases.

- `NO_SCALE`: Don't scale the loaded outline glyph but keep it in font
  units.

  This flag implies `LOAD.NO_HINTING` and `LOAD.NO_BITMAP`, and unsets
  `LOAD.RENDER`.

  If the font is ‘tricky’ (see `FACE_FLAG.TRICKY` for more), using
  `LOAD.NO_SCALE` usually yields meaningless outlines because the
  subglyphs must be scaled and positioned with hinting
  instructions. This can be solved by loading the font without
  `LOAD.NO_SCALE` and setting the character size to
  `~Face.units_per_em`.

- `NO_HINTING`: Disable hinting. This generally generates ‘blurrier’
  bitmap glyphs when the glyph are rendered in any of the anti-aliased
  modes. See also the note below.

  This flag is implied by `LOAD.NO_SCALE`.

- `RENDER`: Render after the glyph is loaded. By default, the glyph is
  rendered in `RENDER_MODE.NORMAL` mode. This can be overridden by
  `LOAD.TARGET_XXX` or `LOAD.MONOCHROME`.

  This flag is unset by `LOAD.NO_SCALE`.

- `NO_BITMAP`: Ignore bitmap strikes when loading. Bitmap-only fonts
  ignore this flag.

  `LOAD.NO_SCALE` always sets this flag.

- `VERTICAL_LAYOUT`: Load the glyph for vertical text layout. In
  particular, the `advance` value in the `Glyph` object is set to the
  `vert_advance` value of the `metrics` field.

  In case `Face.has_vertical` doesn't return `True`, you shouldn't use
  this flag currently. Reason is that in this case vertical metrics
  get synthesized, and those values are not always consistent across
  various font formats.

- `FORCE_AUTOHINT`: Indicates that the auto-hinter is preferred over
  the font's native hinter. See also the note below.

- `CROP_BITMAP`: Indicates that the font driver should crop the loaded
  bitmap glyph (i.e., remove all space around its black bits). Not all
  drivers implement this.

- `PEDANTIC`: Indicates that the font driver should perform pedantic
  verifications during glyph loading. This is mostly used to detect
  broken glyphs in fonts. By default, FreeType tries to handle broken
  fonts also.

  In particular, errors from the TrueType bytecode engine are not
  passed to the application if this flag is not set; this might result
  in partially hinted or distorted glyphs in case a glyph's bytecode
  is buggy.

- `NO_RECURSE`: This flag is only used internally. It merely indicates
  that the font driver should not load composite glyphs
  recursively. Instead, it should set the `num_subglyph` and
  `subglyphs` values of the `Glyph`, and set `Glyph.format`
  to `GLYPH_FORMAT.COMPOSITE`.

  The description of sub-glyphs is not available to client
  applications for now.

  This flag implies `LOAD.NO_SCALE` and `LOAD.IGNORE_TRANSFORM`.

- `IGNORE_TRANSFORM`: Indicates that the transform matrix set by
  `Face.set_transform` should be ignored.

- `MONOCHROME`: This flag is used with `LOAD.RENDER` to indicate that
  you want to render an outline glyph to a 1-bit monochrome bitmap
  glyph, with 8 pixels packed into each byte of the bitmap data.

  Note that this has no effect on the hinting algorithm used. You
  should rather use `LOAD.TARGET_MONO` so that the
  monochrome-optimized hinting algorithm is used.

- `LINEAR_DESIGN`: Indicates that the `linear_hori_advance` and
  `linear_vert_advance` fields of `Glyph` should be kept in font
  units. See `Glyph` for details.

- `NO_AUTOHINT`: Disable auto-hinter. See also the note below.

The following flags select a specific hinting algorithm to use by the
hinter.

- `TARGET_NORMAL`: This corresponds to the default hinting algorithm,
  optimized for standard gray-level rendering. For monochrome output,
  use `LOAD.TARGET_MONO` instead.

- `TARGET_LIGHT`: A lighter hinting algorithm for non-monochrome
  modes. Many generated glyphs are more fuzzy but better resemble its
  original shape. A bit like rendering on Mac OS X.

  As a special exception, this target implies `LOAD.FORCE_AUTOHINT`.

- `TARGET_MONO`: Strong hinting algorithm that should only be used for
  monochrome output. The result is probably unpleasant if the glyph is
  rendered in non-monochrome modes.

- `TARGET_LCD`: A variant of `LOAD.TARGET_NORMAL` optimized for
  horizontally decimated LCD displays.  On many freetype builds, this
  functionality will be disabled due to patent restrictions, in which
  case the resulting bitmap will be grayscale.

- `TARGET_LCD_V`: Strong hinting algorithm that should only be used
  for monochrome output. The result is probably unpleasant if the
  glyph is rendered in non-monochrome modes. On many freetype builds,
  this functionality will be disabled due to patent restrictions, in
  which case the resulting bitmap will be grayscale.
"""

SIZE_REQUEST_TYPE = """
Modes for selecting the size of a bitmap `Face`.

- `NOMINAL`: The nominal size. The `Face.units_per_em` is used to
  determine both scaling values.

- `REAL_DIM`: The real dimension. The sum of the the `~Face.ascender`
  and (minus of) the `~Face.descender` are used to determine both
  scaling values.

- `BBOX`: The font bounding box. The width and height of the
  `~Face.bbox` are used to determine the horizontal and vertical
  scaling value, respectively.

- `CELL`: The `~Face.max_advance_width` is used to determine the
  horizontal scaling value; the vertical scaling value is determined
  the same way as `SIZE_REQUEST_TYPE.REAL_DIM` does. Finally, both
  scaling values are set to the smaller one. This type is useful if
  you want to specify the font size for, say, a window of a given
  dimension and 80x24 cells.

- `SCALES`: Specify the scaling values directly.

The above descriptions only apply to scalable formats. For bitmap
formats, the behaviour is up to the driver.
"""

FSTYPE = """
Bit flags indicating the embedding and subsetting
restrictions of a `Face`.

- `INSTALLABLE_EMBEDDING`: Fonts with no fsType bit set may be
  embedded and permanently installed on the remote system by an
  application.

- `RESTRICTED_LICENSE_EMBEDDING`: Fonts that have only this bit set
  must not be modified, embedded or exchanged in any manner without
  first obtaining permission of the font software copyright owner.

- `PREVIEW_AND_PRINT_EMBEDDING`: If this bit is set, the font may be
  embedded and temporarily loaded on the remote system. Documents
  containing Preview & Print fonts must be opened ‘read-only’; no
  edits can be applied to the document.

- `EDITABLE_EMBEDDING`: If this bit is set, the font may be embedded
  but must only be installed temporarily on other systems. In contrast
  to Preview & Print fonts, documents containing editable fonts may be
  opened for reading, editing is permitted, and changes may be saved.

- `NO_SUBSETTING`: If this bit is set, the font may not be subsetted
  prior to embedding.

- `BITMAP_EMBEDDING_ONLY`: If this bit is set, only bitmaps contained
  in the font may be embedded; no outline data may be embedded. If
  there are no bitmaps available in the font, then the font is
  unembeddable.
"""

KERNING = """
Kerning modes.

- `DEFAULT`: Return scaled and grid-fitted kerning distances (value is
  0).

- `UNFITTED`: Return scaled but un-grid-fitted kerning distances.

- `UNSCALED`: Return the kerning vector in original font units.
