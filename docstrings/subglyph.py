  are words, else bytes.

- `ARGS_ARE_XY_VALUES`: If set, `SubGlyph.arg1` and `SubGlyph.arg2`
  are xy values.

- `ROUND_XY_TO_GRID`: If set, round the xy values to grid.

- `SCALE`: If set, there is a simple scale for the component.

- `XY_SCALE`: If set, the x direction will use a different scale than
  the y direction.

- `TWOXTWO`: If set, there is a 2-by-2 transformation that will be
  used to scale the component. (|freetypy| This is named `2X2` in the
  underlying FreeType library, but was renamed here so it doesn't
  begin with a digit.)

- `USE_MY_METRICS`: Use metrics from this component for the compound
  glyph.
